![JAVA](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built_with-Java-orange)

This repository contains a collection of practical exercises focused on the main concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. 
<br> <br> The exercises were developed as part of the Software Development - Object-Oriented Programming course.

## Repository Structure

The exercises are organized into folders, each covering a specific OOP concept:

- **Encapsulation**: Exercises that demonstrate how to encapsulate data using private fields and public methods.
- **Inheritance**: Examples that show code reuse through class inheritance.
- **Polymorphism**: Exercises showing how objects can be treated as instances of their parent classes.
- **Abstraction**: Exercises involving abstract classes and interfaces.

## How to Run the Exercises

To run the exercises locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vittordallacqua/SoftwareDevelpment-OOP.git
```

2. **Navigate to the exercises folder:**
   
```bash
cd SoftwareDevelpment-OOP/Exercises
```

3. **Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code).**

4. **Run the Java files located in the corresponding folders for each concept.**
