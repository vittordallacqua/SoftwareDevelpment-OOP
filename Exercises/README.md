# 💻 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Exercises

This repository contains a collection of practical exercises focused on the main concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. 
<br> <br>The exercises were developed as part of the Software Development - Object-Oriented Programming course.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The exercises are organized into folders, each covering a specific OOP concept:

- **Encapsulation**: Exercises that demonstrate how to encapsulate data using private fields and public methods.
- **Inheritance**: Examples that show code reuse through class inheritance.
- **Polymorphism**: Exercises showing how objects can be treated as instances of their parent classes.
- **Abstraction**: Exercises involving abstract classes and interfaces.
