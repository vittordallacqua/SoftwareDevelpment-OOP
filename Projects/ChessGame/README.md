### Chess Game in Java (Swing + MVC)

This project aims to develop a chess game in Java with a graphical interface using Swing, structured according to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The game will follow simplified rules — excluding castling, check, and checkmate — and will include persistence of the game state and player rankings.
