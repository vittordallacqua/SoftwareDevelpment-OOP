## 🃏 Truc in Java

Semester project for the Object-Oriented Programming course in Java.

## 📝 Proposal

Develop a Java program to simulate a simple card game, such as "Truco". Implement the following classes:

1. Card: Represents a playing card with a value (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, Q, J, K) and a suit (diamonds, hearts, spades, clubs). (1.0)
2. Deck: Represents a deck of cards containing 48 different cards. Must include a shuffle() method. (1.0)
3. Player: Represents a player in the game, capable of receiving and playing cards on the table. Should have a hand of 3 cards. One of the attributes must be the score. (1.0)
4. Game: Controls the game logic, including card distribution, player turns, and winner determination. (1.0)
5. Implement team-based play (+0.25)
6. Implement the game using sockets (+0.25)
7. Implement the 'Manilha' logic (+0.25)
8. Implement the option to “trucar” (raise the stakes to 3, 6, 9, or 12 points) (+0.25)
